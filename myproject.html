                    <p>Assigned by our Web Design Lecturer for an Interim Assessment, we undertook the task of replicating the 
                        University of Ghana Legon's Computer Science Department website. Each student was responsible for creating 
                        and populating 10 pages, merging theoretical knowledge with practical web design skills. The objective was to 
                        showcase creativity, technical proficiency, and understanding of user experience by emphasizing attention to 
                        detail, design principles, and accurate replication of the existing online platform. The project aimed not only
                         to meet requirements but also to contribute positively to the department's digital representation, 
                         demonstrating professionalism and application of web design concepts. Please pay no attention to the read more button</p>
