                   <p> The study of computer science is therefore critical if society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances.
                     Computer science involves
                     the study and development of applications that allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that support these applications, and
                      the means and methods used to produce both applications and systems that behave reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science 
                      lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current techniques and tools
                       and the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction and maintenance of computer programs.</p>
